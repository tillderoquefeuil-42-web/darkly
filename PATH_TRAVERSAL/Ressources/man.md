## Flag
```

```

## Discovery
On the page http://{IP_ADDRESS}/?page=signin

"?page=signin" is a open gate to the server \
As it runs on UNIX, search the "/etc/passwd" file \
replace "signin" by ".." untill you reach root and then add "/etc/passwd" \
here : http://{IP_ADDRESS}/?page=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

## Use
> access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including \
> application source code or configuration and critical system files

## Prevention
> Prefer working without user input when using file system calls
> Use indexes rather than actual portions of file names when templating or using language files
> Ensure the user cannot supply all parts of the path
> Validate the userâ€™s input by only accepting known good
> Use chrooted jails and code access policies to restrict where the files can be obtained or saved to
